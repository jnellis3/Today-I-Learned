# My First Post

Greetings,

With the new year coming up I decided to commit to creating a TIL blog and host it publicly. This is heavily inspired by [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/), whose has his own TIL that I have learned many things from.

Since I already write documentation for clients, I'm hoping that it should be a relatively easy task to strip out any non-public information and format it into a TIL.

Blogs are created in github and automatically pushed to this site via a workflow.
