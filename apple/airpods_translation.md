# AirPods Live Translation

TIL AirPods Pro 2 have a native "Live Translation" mode that basically turns them into a Star Trek universal translator.

I always assumed I had to fumble around with the Google Translate app to talk to someone in another language. I just found out that if you have iOS 18.1 and AirPods Pro 2, it’s actually built directly into the OS via Apple Intelligence.

### How it works:
You download language packs in your AirPods settings so it works offline. When you need it, you just say, *"Siri, start live translation,"* or pinch the stems.

The wildest part is that it layers the translated audio over the actual person speaking (using Transparency mode), so it feels like a real-time dub.

**The catch:** You do need a phone that supports Apple Intelligence (iPhone 15 Pro or newer) to get the fully integrated experience.

I'm excited to try this when Julia and I go to Paris and Greece during our Honeymoon!
