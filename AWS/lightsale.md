# Lightsail as an alternative to EC2

Today I learned about AWS's Lightsail service, and how much cheaper it can be compared to EC2.

Lightsail provides predictable, fixed monthly pricing and includes storage, networking, and a simplified interface, making it perfect for projects that don't require complex cloud configurations. Unlike EC2, where costs can quickly add up due to additional charges for storage, data transfer, and networking, Lightsail bundles these into a single price. 

It's an excellent option for hosting personal projects, blogs, small web apps, or prototypes where simplicity, affordability, and ease of use are priorities.
