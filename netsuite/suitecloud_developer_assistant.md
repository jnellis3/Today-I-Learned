# NetSuite SuiteCloud Developer Assistant

Today I learned about the new SuiteCloud Developer Assistant, an AI-powered coding companion available in VS Code that provides real-time NetSuite-specific coding assistance. This tool significantly simplifies the development process and shortens the SuiteScript learning curve for developers at all skill levels.
